# Change, Transformation 

One of the most common issues we encounter during data preprocessing in machine learning is the conversion between data types. When working on categorical and numerical data in the data set, it is necessary to be able to express the data numerically in order to teach the machine, that is, to convert the categorical data into numerical data. So, what are these data types and categorical/numeric data?


In this case study, we have a large dataset. Some columns were removed from the data set for encoding work. I am uploading the full version for those who want to use and work with the dataset separately.
Moreover; Some encoding codes written are disabled as an example.
